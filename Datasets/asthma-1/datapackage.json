      "description": "Nearly 1.5 million children in California have asthma and the condition makes it difficult for this group to exercise, play, and attend school.[1] There is evidence that children unable to manage their asthma tend to visit emergency departments (ED) at increased rates.[1] Better management of this chronic disease is critical to reducing ED visits and improving the quality of life for children with asthma. In 2010 (baseline year), there were 73.0 childhood asthma-related ED visits per 10,000 visits. The most recent rate available is 80.6 (2015). We hope to reach a target of 28.0 or lower by 2022.\r\n\r\nLearn more from [Let's Get Healthy California](https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/goals/healthy-beginnings/reducing-childhood-asthma)\r\n\r\n[1] Backman, D., Lee, P., & Paciotti, B.
